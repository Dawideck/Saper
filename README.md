# Saper / MineSweeper
Recreating the classic.

Haven't written a line of code since ~2008... Thought it would be fun to brush up on ol' Java. And what other way than writing a classic game? 
The project still lacks some logic and could've probably been written all-round better, but it's just a proof of concept. 

From the gillion other ways to code MineSweeper I've picked one, where I could work with an array of objects - each tile is one.
